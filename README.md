# Electrical_Products_Analysis
This is my porfolio project which I solve some Data Science tasks with Python libraries.
# Information
This porfolio project used Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer some business questions by their sale data. The data contains thousand of electronic products purchases by month, product type, cost,...
Some data cleaning tasks include:
- Drop NaN value from the dataset
- Add/Remove row with conditions
- Change columns data type (datetimes, astype)
Other Pandas and Matplotlib methods include:
- Concatinate small dataset together to create a new DataFrame
- Adding columns
- Using .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines charts to visualize our results.
